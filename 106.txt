-->Central tendency of data-mean,median,mode
-->central tendency of data- tries to describe the central position (where most data is centered)of data
-->mean,median,mode in which central tendency of data can be calculated
-->Standard deviation-is a measure of how much the members of a data set differ from the mean

So, far we have been restricted to one data set only.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Today , We will learn how two data sets are related to each other
Ex: teamperature vs sale of ice cream/cold drinks
1.Look at the data
2.visually identify if the data sets are corelated
3.calculate the correlation index on a spreadsheet.
